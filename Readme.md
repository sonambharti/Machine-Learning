        <p>
        Machine Learning is set of techniques to make computers better at doing things that humans (traditionally) can do better than machines. <br>
        Machine Learning involves making machines learn things like humans do.

        <h2>Machine Learning Techniques</h2>
        <p>
            There are several machine learning techniques, including:
            <ol>
                <li><b>Supervised Learning</b>: This is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled data. The algorithm is trained on a dataset that has already been labeled, and it learns to make predictions on new, unseen data.</li>
                <li><b>Unsupervised Learning</b>: This is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from unlabeled data. The algorithm is trained on a dataset that has not been labeled, and it learns to identify patterns or relationships in the data.</li>
                <li><b>Reinforcement Learning</b>: This is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from interactions with an environment. The algorithm receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, and it learns to make decisions that maximize the rewards.</li>
            </ol>
